# Tasks
- [ ] Implement a way to store the number of key comparisons made by the sorting algorithm.
- [ ] Implement the sorting algorithms based on this object.
- [ ] Create a dataset generation function and test it programmatically.
- [ ] Run the hybrid sorting algorithms on the dataset and store the number of key comparisons made.
  - [ ] With the value of S fixed, plot the number of key comparisons over different sizes of the input list n. Compare your empirical results with your theoretical analysis of the time complexity.
  - [ ] With the input size n fixed, plot the number of key comparisons over different values of S. Compare your empirical results with your theoretical analysis of the time complexity.
  - [ ] Using different sizes of input datasets, study how to determine an optimal value of S for the best performance of this hybrid algorithm.
- [ ] Compare mergesort performance against hybrid algorithm in terms of the number of key comparisons and CPU times on the dataset with 10 million integers.
# Approach:
1. Functions put in Python files.
2. The analysis done in Jupyter notebook.
